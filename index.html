                    <h2>Origin of the Archive</h2>
                    <p>The Archive is an ongoing creative endeavor, sprouting from the original Terra Project, a long-term working by Cooper Knutson. The Terra Project has been a world-building adventure that began in 2019 on an Applebee's napkin. The goal of this project evolved from a novel, to a tabletop pen and paper game, to a video game. According to the author, the Archive is meant to serve as a Crafter's Guide to the land of Terra, realm of the six elements. With balance and synergy being the core theme of the Terra Project (and Cooper himself being obsessed with old stories of legendary equipment and artifacts), the crafting system will be quite detailed. Although the Archive may appear sparse at this moment, it is a long-term working that will see many updates in the future.</p>

                    <p>As you peruse this online repository, you may notice the neat images and interactive music player. The images are maps that Cooper has personally created, added to the webpage for additional flair and a taste of what is to come! The music was also produced by Cooper, as a litmus test for background music on the project's soundtrack.</p>
